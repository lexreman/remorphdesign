# REMORPH DESIGN CAD FILES #
############################

*Initial public release – January 03, 2026*

**ATTENTION:**  
These files represent the initial public release. 
Minor updates are expected in the near future 
to address CAD clean-up, additional verification, 
sub-assembly refinements, small user-experience improvements, 
and possible modifications to certain parts or assemblies.

Dedicated files for solidworks and f360 will be published after.

The printer has been fully assembled and is currently operational. 
Extensive iteration has been performed on critical components, 
assemblies, and design solutions, 
providing high confidence in the present functionality. 

During this brief refinement period, 
temporary discrepancies may exist between the CAD files and the BOM 
— users are advised to cross-reference both for accuracy.

**Made with love,**  
**Carried on the shoulders of giants,**  
**Released openly for those who aim beyond.**
